The file with the code is entitled "credit_risk_dr" in the Starter_Code folder.

The analysis performed here looks at the risk of loans from a peer-to-peer lending services company. A model was created that can find the trustworthiness of borrowers. The information found in the data included the size of the loan, the interest rate, the income of the borrower, the debt-to-income ratio, the number of accounts, the number of derogatory marks, and the total debt, as well as the loan status (where 0 is a healthy loan and 1 is a high-risk loan).
